Data and code for: The non-random structure of multi-trophic ecological interactions maximises species coexistence

### Summary

the raw data is available in the /data folder, in .RData files that hold nested lists with the raw values of number of visits and number of plant co-occurrences. Every other manipulation is stored in the /results folder.

All results and figures from the study are already generated in the relevant folders. To re-run the analyses, run each script in order. Script with prefix 01 is used to generate community matrices; scripts with prefix 02 are used to calculate different metrics and results; scripts with prefix 03 analyse these metrics and generate figures and tables.

Note that there are different auxiliary scripts both in the main R folder and in one subfolder. Also, please note that some of the scripts are very computationally demanding.
